"question": "What is the sine of an angle in a right triangle if the opposite side is 6 and the hypotenuse is 10?",
"options": ["0.6", "0.8", "0.9", "1.0"],
"answerIndex": 0,
"explanation": "The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. So, sin(theta) = opposite/hypotenuse = 6/10 = 0.6."

"answerIndex": 1,
"explanation": "The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse. So, cos(theta) = adjacent/hypotenuse = 4/5 = 0.8."

"answerIndex": 0,
"explanation": "The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. So, tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent = 4/3 = 1.333. Rounded to two decimal places, this is approximately 0.75."

"answerIndex": 0,
"explanation": "The sine of 45 degrees is equal to the cosine of 45 degrees, and both are equal to the square root of 2 divided by 2. Rounded to one decimal place, this is approximately 0.7."
